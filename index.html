            Hello! Thanks for stopping by.<br><br>
            I come from a place located on the outskirts of Kolkata, the capital city in the eastern state of West Bengal in India, also known as the 'City of Joy.' 
            Currently, I am stationed in Bengaluru in India as part of my work.<br><br>
            I am an engineer interested in the study of advanced finite element methods for research and modelling of fracture and fatigue in materials. I have a B.E. in Civil Engineering from Jadavpur University 
            and an M.Tech. in Structural Engineering from IIT Kanpur.<br><br>
            Currently, I am working as an engineer at Airbus India. A detailed resume of mine can be found <a style="color: red;" href="/res/pdf/Resume/Resume_Rupsagar_Chatterjee_v5_1_18.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.<br><br>
